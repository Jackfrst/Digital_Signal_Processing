# Digital_Signal_Processing
 This is the Repository containing all the code I have worked upon at the Digital signale Processing Lab on school.
 
Digital signal processing (DSP) refers to the manipulation and analysis of digital signals using mathematical and computational techniques. It involves processing and transforming signals represented as sequences of numbers, typically sampled from continuous-time signals.
